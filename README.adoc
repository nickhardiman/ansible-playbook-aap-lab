= Ansible playbook for turning a PC into a set of Ansible Automation Platform VMs

Ansible helps me build my home lab. 
This playbook turns a PC running RHEL 9 into a hypervisor running a pile-load (that's the technical term) of Virtual Machines. 
Each VM runs a set of services that support my home lab. 

Idea is to build the 
Ansible Automation Platform 2
Reference Architecture.
